# NFL Fantasy Football Article Data Analysis Project

This project investigates whether sentiment expressed in fantasy football player outlook articles can help predict NFL player fantasy performance. We apply natural language processing techniques to expert writeups and combine those insights with player performance data to evaluate whether overall sentiment adds predictive value beyond traditional statistics.

## Software and Platform:
This project was developed using the following tools and environment:

## Programming Language
- Python
## Python Packages
- pandas - data manipulation and analysis
- beautifulsoup4 - web scraping and HTML parsing
- requests - retrieving web page content
- ntlk (VADER Sentiment Analyzer) - sentiment scoring of text
- json - handling structured text data
- re (regular expressions) - text cleaning and preprocessing
- csv - reading and writing structured data files
## Platform
- Used macOS

## Repository Structure
This repository follows a simplified structure inspired by the TIER Protocol 4.0 to promote reproducibility and clarity.
